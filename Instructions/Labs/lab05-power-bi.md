# LAB 05: Power BI

In this lab, you will build a Power BI dashboard that visualizes data about problems reported by company employees.

## What you will learn

  - How to connect to Dataverse 
  - How to refine the data model and prepare it for reporting
  - How to create a Power BI visualization 
  - How to embed a Power BI report in Microsoft Teams

## High-level lab steps

We will follow the below steps to design and create the Power BI dashboard:

-   Connect to tables in Microsoft Dataverse 
-   Transform the data to include user-friendly descriptions for the related Rows (lookups)
-    Create and publish a report with various visualizations of the information about problem reports
-    User natural language query to build additional visualizations
-    Build mobile view
-    Embed the Company 311 Power BI report to Microsoft Teams

## Prerequisites

* Must have completed **Lab 02.1: Data model and model-driven app**
* Permissions to install programs on your computer (required for Power BI Desktop installation)

## Things to consider before you begin

-   Who is the target audience of the report?
-   How will the audience consume the report? Typical device? Location?
-   Do you have sufficient data to visualize?
-   What are the possible characteristics you can use to analyze data about the visits?

## Detailed steps

### Exercise 1: Prepare environment & data  

**Objective:** In this exercise, you will install and configure Power BI Desktop and configure a connection to Microsoft Dataverse. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you do not have required permissions to install desktop applications or experience difficulties in configuring Power BI Desktop and connecting it to the data, follow **Addendum: Import sample data** and then continue on **Exercise 2** but using Power BI service instead of Power BI Desktop.

#### Task 1: Configure Power BI Desktop

1. If you do not have Power BI Desktop installed, navigate to [https://aka.ms/pbidesktopstore](https://aka.ms/pbidesktopstore) to download and install Power BI app.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you experience issues installing Power BI Desktop using Microsoft Store, try standalone installer that can be downloaded from [https://aka.ms/pbiSingleInstaller](https://aka.ms/pbiSingleInstaller).

2. Open Power BI Desktop.
2. If you signed in into Power BI Desktop previously, select **File | Sign out** 
3. Sign in if prompted or select **File | Sign in** to sign in.
